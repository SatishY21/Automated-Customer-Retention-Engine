🛡️ ChurnGuard: Proactive Customer Retention Platform
ChurnGuard is an end-to-end application that leverages machine learning to predict customer churn and automates the retention process. This tool provides an interactive interface to identify high-risk customers and triggers an intelligent workflow to proactively engage them with retention offers.

Key Features
🔮 Predictive Analytics: Utilizes a trained Logistic Regression model to accurately predict the likelihood of a customer churning based on their service history and usage patterns.

💻 Interactive UI: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit that allows for easy batch prediction by simply uploading a CSV file.

🤖 Automated Retention Workflow: For customers identified as high-risk, the app can trigger an n8n webhook, initiating a custom workflow that can automatically send personalized retention emails, special offers, or create support tickets.

✅ High Performance: The model is built on a robust Scikit-learn pipeline, ensuring efficient data preprocessing and reliable predictions.

⚙️ System Workflow
The application follows a simple yet powerful end-to-end workflow:

graph TD
    A[User uploads CSV of customers] --> B{Streamlit UI};
    B --> C[Load Scikit-learn Model];
    C --> D{Predict Churn Likelihood};
    D -- If Churn is 'Yes' --> E[Display 'Send Retention Email' Button];
    D -- If Churn is 'No' --> F[Display 'No Action Needed'];
    E -- On Click --> G[Trigger n8n Webhook];
    G --> H(n8n Automation Engine);
    H --> I[Generate Personalized Email via AI];
    I --> J[Send Email to Customer];

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend & Model: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Joblib

Frontend: Streamlit

Automation: n8n (via Webhooks)
